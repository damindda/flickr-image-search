Hello Nic,

Thanks for the excercise.

I have not used Flickr API before and hence had to spend little more time for that because the REST API image url generation I had to take a look,
because of that I preume this took me more than 4 hours.
Tried to finish with in the timeframe of 4.30 hours.

I have used NgRx store to manage state.

I have used ngx infite scroll for infinite scrolling
https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-infinite-scroll

Installation

Do a
- npm install
- run "npm run start or ng serve" command after that
- It should run in the default port 4200
- navigate to http://localhost:4200/ it will open up.

Best,
Daminda Jayaratne
